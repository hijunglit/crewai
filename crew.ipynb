      "**Dish Name: Greek Moussaka**  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredients Required (Serves 5):**  \n",
      "- 3 medium eggplants  \n",
      "- 500g ground lamb or beef  \n",
      "- 1 large onion, finely chopped  \n",
      "- 2 cloves garlic, minced  \n",
      "- 400g canned tomatoes, crushed  \n",
      "- 2 tablespoons tomato paste  \n",
      "- 1 teaspoon dried oregano  \n",
      "- 1 teaspoon cinnamon  \n",
      "- Salt and pepper, to taste  \n",
      "- 3 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced  \n",
      "- 2 tablespoons olive oil  \n",
      "- 2 cups béchamel sauce (store-bought or homemade)  \n",
      "- 100g grated Parmesan cheese (or Kefalotyri cheese, if available)  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Preparation Instructions:**  \n",
      "1. **Prepare the Eggplants:** Slice the eggplants into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Sprinkle salt on both sides and let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out moisture and bitterness. Rinse and pat dry with paper towels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cook the Potatoes:** Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Boil the sliced potatoes in salted water until just tender (about 10 minutes). Drain and set aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cook the Meat Mixture:** In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and minced garlic, sautéing until soft (about 5 minutes). Add in the ground lamb or beef and cook until browned. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15 minutes until the mixture thickens.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fry the Eggplants:** In another pan, heat a bit of olive oil over medium-high heat. Fry the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Assemble the Moussaka:** In a large baking dish, layer the ingredients. Start with a layer of potatoes, followed by half of the meat mixture, a layer of eggplants, another half of the meat mixture, and then the remaining eggplants on top. Pour the béchamel sauce over the entire dish, making sure to cover it evenly. Sprinkle the grated cheese on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Bake:** Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbling.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Rest Before Serving:** Allow the moussaka to rest for about 15-20 minutes before slicing to ensure the layers hold together.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Serving Suggestions:**  \n",
      "Serve the moussaka warm, garnished with fresh parsley or mint. It pairs beautifully with a simple Greek salad (cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, olives, and feta cheese dressed with olive oil and oregano) and a glass of red wine.

      "As Deadline’s Most Valuable Blockbuster tournament comes to a close, with the two most profitable movies of 2024 unveiled Thursday, we look at the movies that didn’t work. Streaming continues to be a wildcard: While traditional motion picture studios such as Disney, Warner Bros, Sony, Paramount and Universal rely on lucrative pay two and pay three streamer deals to catapult their slates into the black, those streamers who’ve embraced theatrical (specifically Amazon MGM Studios and Apple Original Films) have a clandestine metric as to how they evaluate a movie’s post-cinema success. By traditional studio P&L standards, some of those releases would be considered flops. Given that, Apple and Amazon are excluded from this year’s survey. \n",

      "KRAVEN THE HUNTERSony PicturesNet Loss: $71 million\n",
      "\tFirst of all, it should noted that the overall loss here is for the film in its entirety. Sony smartly co-financed this grounded gangster Marvel movie with TSG, so its loss is less than $35 million. Kraven the Hunter, who is one of Spider-Man’s foes, opened to $11M stateside, the lowest start for any Sony/Marvel title (the Culver City lot owns largely the Spiderverse portion of the Marvel catalog, while Disney owns the rest). Kraven the Hunter began production in 2022, with reshoots taking place in November 2023 after the actors strike was resolved; the start and restart drove production costs from $90M to $110M. During this time there was a cultural shift by audiences in their attitude toward superhero movies” they just expected more, and this bare-chested, leopard-pants-and-leather-vest-wearing rifleman wasn’t going to cut it (the pic received a C CinemaScore). The release date jumped around the calendar, too, first dated for MLK weekend 2023, then October 6, 2023, then Labor Day weekend 2024 before finally landing on December 13, the pre-holiday Christmas frame where Sony had launched the Jumanji movies and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. Despite tanking with $25M domestic and $62M worldwide, Kraven the Hunter did manage to pull off $40M in global home entertainment and $50M in TV and streaming revenues. Residuals were less than other films as Kraven the Hunter was made in the UK. While Sony’s Marvel title Madame Web bombed earlier in the year, its red ink isn’t as great as what we see here on Kraven. Then-Sony Pictures CEO Tony Vinciquerra said at the time that Kraven and Madame both failed due to the media’s crucifixion of such titles. When asked if the strategy around the Spider-Man spinoffs should be refocused, he told the Los Angeles Times, “I do think we need to rethink it, just because it’s snake-bitten. If we put another one out, it’s going to get destroyed, no matter how good or bad it is.”\n",

      "MEGALOPOLISLionsgateNet Loss: $75.5 million\n",
      "\tBox office bombs are in the moment. However, any misfire, especially one from an auteur, can last a lifetime, particularly now with streaming and FAST channels in need of content, not to mention in the endless film studies conversations at universities around the world. With that, Francis Ford Coppola‘s two-decade dream project Megalopolis, financed from his own money for $120 million as well as $16M in domestic P&A, winds up on the 2024 list of bombs. Important to note that Coppola funded Megalopolis by borrowing $200M against his ownership stake in Delicato Family Wines; that equity deal reportedly was worth $650M.\n",
      "\tThe sophisticated movie followed ambitious architectural idealist Cesar (Adam Driver) in the City of New Rome. He yearns for a utopian, idealistic future but comes up against Mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), who remains committed to a regressive status quo, perpetuating greed, special interests and partisan warfare. Complicating matters is that Cesar is in love with Cicero’s daughter, socialite Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel). The movie was screened at the Universal CityWalk in Imax prior to Cannes (where it nabbed a seven-minute standing ovation) before Coppola’s friends. Coppola’s longtime lawyer Barry Hirsch and Vincent Maraval, president of Goodfellas (ex-Wild Bunch International), brokered the new Megalopolis foreign-sales deals, which our sources estimate at $50M here. Key foreign rights sold faster than U.S., i.e., major Euro territories Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, UK and France sold before Coppola and cast walked up the stairs of the Palais. By June, Lionsgate brokered a distribution deal for the film, the studio having handled the filmmaker’s Zoetrope library director’s cuts like Apocalypse Now Final Cut, The Conversation, The Cotton Club Encore, Tucker: The Man and His Dream and One From the Heart: Reprise. Imax committed to Coppola before Lionsgate, promising a 20-city release. One of the pic’s stunts included having a live actor (playing a reporter who talks to Driver on the screen) at key metro Imax auditorium, the gimmick first seen at Megalopolis‘ Cannes premiere. Imax contributed 41% of the movie’s $4M domestic opening weekend. Those moviegoers who attended were 61% fans of Coppola per Comscore/Screen Engine’s PostTrak, while a third were Driver fans. Lionsgate has no skin in the game; it was merely a gun for hire by Coppola at a distribution fee between $3M-$5M.\n",
      "\tPrior to opening, there was a major marketing snafu with the trailer containing false AI-generated quotes from critics about Coppola. The trailer was pulled, but that’s not what hurt Megalopolis at the box office, as critics never understood the movie from the start out of its Cannes premiere (45% on Rotten Tomatoes), nor did the few moviegoers who showed up, pummeling Megalopolis with a D+ CinemaScore and a very low 32% definite recommend.\n",

      "BORDERLANDSLionsgateNet Loss: $80 million\n",
      "\tLionsgate during the pre-Adam Fogelson era thought it had a hit on its hands when they decided to make a feature take of the video game Borderlands, which had sold 68 million units. Clearly, Borderlands was no A Minecraft Movie, or even Sonic the Hedgehog. Even though the studio safeguarded in selling foreign for $70 million, our film finance sources assert that the black eye here is around $80M — greater than the $30M loss being floated around the time the movie tanked. It opened to $8.6M stateside; whupped by Sony/Wayfarer’s Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni movie It Ends With Us in the No. 2 spot with a $50M opening, and the third weekend of Deadpool & Wolverine with $53.7M. The execution in its Mad Max-meets-Tank Girl look was too gonzo for fanboys, many of whom who were also turned off by two-time Oscar winner Cate Blanchett going out of her zone as a bounty hunter. Reshoots on this Eli Roth-directed movie were handled by Deadpool director Tim Miller, and that swelled the budget even more to $120M.\n",
      "\tSaid Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer about the Borderlands misfire an earnings call: “Nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong: it sat on the shelf for too long during the pandemic, and reshoots and rising interest rates took it outside the safety zone of our usual strict financial models.” Ultimately, these bombs make money in their fifth and sixth cycles, not the first phase, which all of our P&L modeling reflects. At the time Borderlands deep-sixed we heard from a Lionsgate insider some good news: Eight years after its release, the Gerard Butler disaster Gods of Egypt finally broke even.\n",

      "FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGAWarner BrosNet Loss: $119.6 million\n",
      "\tGeorge Miller has a Mad Max universe mapped out. However, in the wake of rebooting the franchise with Tom Hardy for Mad Max: Fury Road ($380 million global box office, $150M production cost, six Oscar wins), the Australian filmmaker decided not to go with a sequel but rather a prequel centered around Fury Road’s female hero Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron. But the prequel didn’t have Theron reprising her role, one of the reasons why the movie didn’t reach an equal-sized audience — this a despite Furiosa starring the MCU’s Thor, Chris Hemsworth, as the villain. Miller rolled the dice on The Queen’s Gambit streaming sensation Anya Taylor-Joy in a younger version of Furiosa as he didn’t want to CGI Theron’s younger self. Marketing looked too similar to Mad Max: Fury Road, thus not spurring want-to-see, not to mention people couldn’t make head nor tails of all the noise in the trailer. Despite a standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival premiere, 90% Certified Fresh reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a B+ CinemaScore on par with Fury Road, the big takeaway was that Mad Max pictures have a limited audience, even if they’re positioned as the big film over Memorial Day. The solution? Make them for considerably less than $168M net in Australia.\n",

      "\tBefore Deadpool & Wolverine, Warner Bros/DC’s Joker was the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever at $1.1 billion with two Oscar wins, including Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix’s portrayal of the Travis Bickle-like Batman villain. Director Todd Phillips found a way for a sequel, and Warners committed to the craziness of it at an opulent spend of $200M. When it came a budget that high for a movie that didn’t possess a lot of CGI, why so serious? Because Phillips has delivered Warner Bros’ hundreds of millions of dollars over the years with The Hangover franchise, Joker and more. Add in Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, and that’s a home run, right? Not quite. With a D CinemaScore, nobody wanted to see a Joker sequel that had the sensibility of a Stephen Sondheim musical.\n",

      "Does this take into consideration the fact that the film studios do NOT get back 100% of the tickets sold…? I think in the USA, if a movie makes $100mil the studio gets back MAYBE 50% or slightly less? But internationally they get back about 30/40% so really for a movie with a 200mil usd budget it would have to make more like 400mil to turn a profit. Not including marketing and any other expenses/costs, of course. Cinemas don’t screen films for free unlike what the press and studios try to make us think.\n",

Because the article here clearly states box office total and then shows theatrical revenue, which is that net profit remaining of what came back to studios after the theatres took their share. Which is why the Joker 2 200mil comes down to only 87 theatrical revenue. You could have just read what it says on the data sheet.\n",

      "Since the dawn of cinema, the box office has been a crucial element in the movie industry that can easily make or break a film depending on its financial performance. In recent years, the number of movie goers has unfortunately dwindled at the theaters, which has taken a massive toll on the box office and hurt movies that actually earn rave reviews from audiences and critics. The year 2024 gave movie fans a handful of solid films, but it also delivered a string of bombs at the box office which is likely to be expected in any year. While there are a few films that received positive reviews but fell short of their projected numbers, there were also a handful of movies, such as The Crow, Joker: Folie á Deux, and Borderlands that just tanked both with audiences and the box office. Out of all the movies released in 2024, including The Fall Guy, Fly Me to the Moon, and Argylle, these are the ten biggest bombs at the box office, ranked. \n",

      "Image via Lionsgate\n",
      "The science-fiction action comedy, Borderlands, is one film of the year that came and went, barely making a dent in the box office opening weekend. Based on the video game series by the same name, Borderlands stars Cate Blanchett as an outlaw who returns to her home planet where she forms an alliance with a group of misfits to try and find the daughter of the most powerful man in the universe. According to Deadline, Borderlands was projected to cost the studio $20 to $30 million dollars due to its disappointing release, but the film did cause an increase in sales of the video game, proving at least a minor silver lining to its failure. Aside from failing at the box office, Borderlands was also panned by audiences and critics, citing it as a mediocre adaptation that fell short in every area imaginable.\n",

      "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is the latest installment in George Miller's franchise that, despite performing poorly at the box office, did earn overall positive reviews. The film follows the origin story of Fury Road character, Furoisa, played by Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne, and her journey from being kidnapped as a child all the way to her rise to the rank of Imperator. Many critics and outlets, including Collider's Chris McPherson cited the lack of interest in the famous franchise and its prequels were a major contribution to the film's downfall. The movie earned five out of five stars from Empire's John Nugent, who praised Taylor-Joy's performance, noting it to be a fitting tribute to Charlize Theron's original character. The fact that Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga did receive numerous positive reviews just proves that sometimes the box office isn't always a movie's ultimate deciding factor. \n",

When the star of the movie suddenly disappears, Seavers soon finds himself in the middle of an unexpected conspiracy. The Fall Guy is another film that received rather exceptional reviews but sadly failed to stick the landing at the box office. Overall, the movie earned a worldwide total of over one-hundred and eighty million dollars. According to Variety, The Fall Guy would have had to gross between $275 to $300 million dollars in order to break even, ultimately resulting in a financial loss for the studio. Despite flopping at the box office, several critics commended The Fall Guy for its level of entertainment, which was a refreshing change from today's heavy CGI and lack of character development seen in most movies. \n",

      "Fly Me to the Moon is a romantic comedy set during the approaching days of NASA launching Apollo 11 for its historical moon landing. While NASA feels confident in their mission, they decide to lean towards the side of caution and resort to orchestrating a fake moon landing in case the mission goes south. They recruit an advertising executive (Scarlett Johansson) who must work with one of NASA's launch directors (Channing Tatum) and other staff members to put on a convincing show. Fly Me to the Moon flopped at the box office but not as hard as some of the other films of 2024. It was projected to earn about $12 million during the opening weekend, but it still came up short, earning only a little north of $4 million. Despite the film's star-power and unique concept, Fly Me to the Moon wasn't well received by general audiences, but some critics did praise Johansson and Tatum's screwball comedic chemistry as the film's saving grace.\n",

      "Guy Ritchie's action-packed movie The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is set during World War II and follows a group of men who are recruited by Winston Churchill to exterminate Adolf Hitler's fleet of U-Bombers. The team operates under the radar, allowing them to use unconventional methods to complete their mission and hopefully change the course of the war. The film is a highly fictionalized telling of Operation Postmaster and is based on the 2014 novel, Churchill's Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperados of WWII by Damien Lewis. Even though the film had Ritchie at the helm captaining a star-studded cast including Henry Cavill, Cary Elwes and Smallville's Alan Ritchson, nothing could've saved this movie from sinking at the box office, grossing only a little over $27 million on a $60 million dollar budget. The main issue with The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is that it was presented with a ready-to-go and compelling story but instead, it was drowned out by oversaturated action and a mindless structure that failed to capture the importance of the real-life heroes and their dangerous mission.\n",

      "The initial previews for Argylle seemed somewhat promising, featuring an interesting plot with an ensemble cast, but the movie's performance at the box office was devastating. Bryce Dallas Howard stars in the espionage comedy as a best-selling author, Elly Conway, who has gained success with her book series about a secret agent named Argylle. When the plots of Conway's books begin to reflect the actions of a real-life spy operation, she's thrown into a world that toes the line between reality and fiction. Argylle is a stand-alone spin-off of the popular Kingsman franchise with a crossover between the films in a shared universe. With a $200 million dollar budget, Argylle only earned $96 million at the global box office, deeming it to be a disappointing box office bomb. To add insult to injury, the film earned overall negative reviews, many addressing how the film starts off with an exciting, silly twist on the traditional spy thriller but loses its momentum about mid-way through.\n",

      "Many film fans had high hopes for Francis Ford Coppola's highly anticipated movie, Megalopolis, which had been delayed several times, creating more suspense for its debut. When it finally made it to the silver screen, many were baffled by the epic science-fiction film drama that seemed more focused on presenting a visual spectacle than a compelling story. Set in an alternate 21st century, Megalopolis follows an ambitious architect (Adam Driver) whose visions cause him to clash with opposing forces of power, especially the city's mayor (Giancarlo Esposito). The Godfather director has a reputation for genre hopping, ranging from intense dramas to romantic comedies, but no one could have ever expected the utter tragedy of Megalopolis, which only earned $13 million (against a whooping $136 million dollar budget) at the box office. Instead of delivering a captivating narrative, Coppola's Megalopolis is essentially a series of visually stunning scenes that, aside from their visual appeal, come off like a bewildering and confusing puzzle.\n",

      "There are some movies that should never be remade and when fans learned that the 1994 movie The Crow was set to be remade, almost everyone knew it would be a major flop. The original film has almost a sacred legacy that is beloved and protected by fans, not only due to Brandon Lee's tragic death but also, his incomparable performance that is impossible to match, let alone surpass. Bill Skarsgård stars as Eric Davern who, along with his soulmate, are brutally murdered and when he's given the chance to save his true love by sacrificing himself, he takes the opportunity to seek his revenge against those who took their lives. Deadline called the premiere of The Crow \"disastrous,\" earning only a total of $24 million worldwide against a $50 million dollar budget. It's hard to understand how and why anyone thought remaking this treasured cult classic would be even somewhat of a success and, while it's not a knock against Skarsgård, the film felt like a cheap money grab the studio thought they could pull off with some over-the-top action and gore. The original had its fair share of violence and bloodshed, but unlike the remake, its main appeal was Lee's tour de force performance as well as the magnitude of storytelling.\n",

      "Marvel's Madame Web made history as one of the lowest-grossing films in the comic franchise, becoming the ultimate punch-line of superhero movies. The film follows the origin story of Cassie Web (Dakota Johnson) who, after discovering that she has supernatural powers, tries to save three other women from Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who wants to kill them before they can become Spider-Women in the future. Surprisingly, Madame Web broke close to even at the box office, earning a little over $100 million worldwide against nearly the same budget. With any Marvel film, fans will almost always flock to the theaters to see it, but while Madame Web also failed to accumulate any significant profit, it also earned painfully negative reviews from critics. The movie has an initially interesting approach, but it essentially unfolds with an uneven and choppy execution, feeling broken and jumbled with several humorous moments that were not intended to be comical. Between its airless, stiff tone and mechanical storyline, Madame Web is without question Sony's worst film in the entire Spider-Man Universe to date.\n",

      "After the immense success of Todd Phillips' stand-alone film, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix, fans were thrilled to learn that a second film was in the works. Considered to be one of the year's most anticipated films, Joker: Folie á Deux is a less than inspired sequel which was met with less than positive reviews and is easily the year's most surprising box office bomb. The film picks up with Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) who is being held at Arkham Asylum and as he struggles with his duel identity, he meets the love of his life, Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga). Fans were aware that the film was set to be a musical, but no one ever expected to see the absolute disaster which unfolded on the big screen, resulting in many viewers walking out of the theaters mid-way through. Joker: Folie á Deux grossed over $200 million at the global box office and, according to Variety, the film's even breaking point was about $450 million, resulting in a hefty financial loss for Warner Bros. Even though other films of 2024 tanked hard at the box office, there's no denying that Joker: Folie á Deux takes the cake as the biggest box office bomb of the year. \n",

# "Epic Fails of 2024: The Movies that Missed the Mark"

Welcome to our annual cinematic recap where we take a look at the films that didn't quite hit the bullseye. 2024 was a year filled with anticipation for some major releases but not all lived up to the hype. Let's dive into the biggest box office flops of the year.

## Joker: Folie à Deux

Despite the success of its predecessor, "Joker: Folie à Deux" fell flat with a net loss of $144.25 million. The sequel's musical sensibility was a misfire with audiences, leading to a dismal D CinemaScore. It seems the joke was on Warner Bros this time.

## Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga

Charlize Theron's absence was felt in "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga", which suffered a net loss of $119.6 million. Despite positive reviews, the audience turnout was lukewarm at best. Perhaps the Mad Max magic was missing without Theron.

## Borderlands

Adapting video games to the big screen is always a risk and "Borderlands" proved it with a net loss of $80 million. The film failed to resonate with the game's fans, and expensive reshoots blew up the budget, leading to a significant financial loss for Lionsgate.

## Megalopolis

Even a great director like Francis Ford Coppola can miss the mark, as shown by "Megalopolis". Despite being a hit at film festivals, audiences didn't flock to see it, leading to a net loss of $75.5 million.

## Kraven the Hunter

Sony Pictures' "Kraven the Hunter" proved that even Marvel's magic touch has its limits. With a gangster twist on the character, the film suffered the lowest opening for a Sony/Marvel title and a net loss of $71 million.

In the world of cinema, not every film can be a hit, and these movies prove that point. Despite their losses, they each brought something unique to the table, and we look forward to what 2025 has to offer.

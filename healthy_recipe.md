**Vegetarian Greek Moussaka**

**Ingredients Required (Serves 5):**  
- 3 medium eggplants  
- 500g lentils (cooked; green or brown)  
- 1 large onion, finely chopped  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 400g canned tomatoes, crushed  
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste  
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano  
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon  
- Salt and pepper, to taste  
- 3 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced  
- 2 tablespoons olive oil  
- 2 cups béchamel sauce (store-bought or homemade, made with plant-based milk)  
- 100g grated plant-based cheese (or nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor)  

**Preparation Instructions:**  
1. **Prepare the Eggplants:** Slice the eggplants into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Sprinkle salt on both sides and let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out moisture and bitterness. Rinse and pat dry with paper towels.

2. **Cook the Potatoes:** Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Boil the sliced potatoes in salted water until just tender (about 10 minutes). Drain and set aside.

3. **Cook the Lentil Mixture:** In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and minced garlic, sautéing until soft (about 5 minutes). Add the cooked lentils and cook for a few minutes until heated through. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15 minutes until the mixture thickens.

4. **Fry the Eggplants:** In another pan, heat a bit of olive oil over medium-high heat. Fry the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.

5. **Assemble the Moussaka:** In a large baking dish, layer the ingredients. Start with a layer of potatoes, followed by half of the lentil mixture, a layer of eggplants, another half of the lentil mixture, and then the remaining eggplants on top. Pour the béchamel sauce over the entire dish, making sure to cover it evenly. Sprinkle the grated plant-based cheese on top.

6. **Bake:** Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbling.

7. **Rest Before Serving:** Allow the moussaka to rest for about 15-20 minutes before slicing to ensure the layers hold together.

**Serving Suggestions:**  
Serve the moussaka warm, garnished with fresh parsley or mint. It pairs beautifully with a simple Greek salad (cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, olives, and feta cheese dressed with olive oil and oregano) and a glass of red wine. Enjoy a slice of this hearty dish alongside some crusty bread to soak up the delicious flavors!

**Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients:**  
- **Ground Lamb/Beef**: Replaced with cooked lentils to maintain a hearty texture and protein content, while ensuring the dish remains vegetarian.
- **Béchamel Sauce**: Can be made with plant-based milk (like almond or soy) to keep it vegan-friendly while still creating a creamy topping.
- **Grated Cheese**: Swapped for plant-based cheese or nutritional yeast, which helps achieve a cheesy flavor without using dairy. 

This vegetarian Greek Moussaka retains the essence and flavors of the traditional dish, while being healthy and satisfying for everyone to enjoy!
